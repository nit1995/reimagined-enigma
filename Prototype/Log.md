1. Problem with inteerfacing DS3231. Looks to be an I2C or Power issue. Needs debugging. 

2. M2 succesfully made without RTC. **No timestamp**.

3. M3 - pH Sensor, Conductivity Meter and Level Sensor integrated to M2. Problem with RTC not resolved. **No time stamp**. **Calibration of Conductivity Meter required.**
